# :warning: Project discontinued
This project has been discontinued in November 2018. Google has removed the ability to subscribe to broadcast events for the Wi-Fi events from the Manifest and the new APIs providing similar functionnalities are not sufficient to provide the same functionality that Wi-Fi Timer used to provide.

==========================================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/laurentsebag/android-wifi-timer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/laurentsebag/android-wifi-timer)

__Spare your battery life by deactivating wifi for a few hours using Wifi
Timer!__

When installed, each time you turn your wifi off, you will be asked how
long you would like before restoring it. After that amount of time has
passed, your wifi will be automatically turned back on.
